Animation 

Use the [transform] to apply transformations to element 
The most common transformation functions are 
rotate(angle)                : rotate with definited angle  
skew(x-angle,y-angle)        : define a 2D skew transformation along the X- and the Y-axis
To create a custom animation, define the keyframes which includes the list of styles to be applied.
Once we define the keyframes, we can use the animation property to animate an element.
