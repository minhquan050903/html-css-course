1. CSS Inheritance 
color : initial ; : apply default color (black)

Some CSS attributes are inherited from their parent element. Text stylistic attributes such as text colour, font, font size, and so on are often inherited.
 We can halt inheritance by setting a property's value to initial. To enforce inheritance, we should set the value of an inheritable property.

Example : Inheritance file 

2.Colors 
4 ways to present colors in CSS 

- use named color
- RGB value  
- HSL value
- Hexadecimal value

3. Gradients
background: linear-gradient(dodgerblue,yellow) : transfer from blue to yellow (from top to bottom by default ))
Gradients are images so they cannot be used as the value of background-color property. We can use them as the value of background-imageor background properties.

4. Borders 
border: 10px solid royalblue; : border with thickness of 10pixels , solid type and have royal blue color 
The border property is a shortcut for the border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left properties. It accepts three values: the border's thickness, style, and colour.
We also have border-width, border-style, and border-color attributes. For the top, right, bottom, and left borders, these attributes accept four values.
