1. Providing CSS 

We can select elements and apply CSS by their type, class, attribute or ID

3 ways to provide css : internal (styling in an HTML document) , external(written in a separate file ) , and inline styles ( written in an HTML element by using the style attribute). 
Example : in Providing CSS folder 

External is the best choice because it is easy to make a change on muliple HTML files that link to CSS file 

2. Basic selector 
target="_blank" : Open link in a new tab of the browser
a[href^="https"] : Apply CSS  to attribute that starts with given value (here is "https") 
a[href$=".com"] : Apply CSS  to attribute that starts with given value (here is ".com") 
Example : Basic selector folder

3. Relational selector 
#products p {} : Apply css  to <p> element (paragraph) inside the product ID 
Example : Relational selector folder
